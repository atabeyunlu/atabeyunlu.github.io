I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at DeltaWave with expertise in AI-driven solutions for biotechnology and drug discovery. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics, combined with hands-on experience in developing generative models and utilizing natural language processing architectures for drug design and molecular property prediction. My research spans ML/AI, chemistry, biology, computation, and automation.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch.
